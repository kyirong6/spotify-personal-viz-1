            <h1>Personal Spotify Viz!</h1>
            <p>
                This is a series of visualizations that aid in exploring and analyzing my listening habits. The data was fetched using
                <a href="https://github.com/plamere/spotipy">spotipy</a>, a Python client for the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/">Spotify Web API</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The data behind these visualizations include my top artists, genres, and audio features I gravitate towards. Moreover, the data 
                is also divided into different time ranges. The <b>short_term</b> uses the past <i>4 weeks</i> of data, <b>medium_term</b> is the past <i>6 months</i>, and <b>long_term</b>
                is <i>several years</i> worth of data.
            </p>

                describe various attributes of a song such as: danceability, energy, speechiness, valence, and more...Analyzing and visualizing these features allows me to better understand 
                the types of songs I listen to and why I listen to them. Moreover, viewing my listening habits over a time range also gives me some feedback on how my tendancies have changed
                over time.

                <h3>Average of Audio Features on All Time Ranges</h3>
                <p>The bar chart to the left describes my average audio features in totality. Spotify describes each feature as such:</p>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><i><b>danceability</b></i>: "Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination elements including tempo, rhythm stability, and beat." </li>
                        <li><i><b>energy</b></i>: "A perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy." </li>
                        <li><i><b>speechiness</b></i>: "Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value." </li>
                        <li><i><b>acousticness</b></i>: "A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic." </li>
                        <li><i><b>instrumentalness</b></i>: "Predicts whether a track contains no vocals." </li>
                        <li><i><b>liveness</b></i>: "Detects the presence of an audience in the recording." </li>
                        <li><i><b>valence</b></i>: "A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track." </li>
                      </ol>
